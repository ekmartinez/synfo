# synfo - Summaries of Local Machine Specs

This system utility tool will be very useful for IT personnel and other enthusiasts.  It provides a quick and easy way to see basic system information like CPU, RAM, swap & hard drive utilization.  Very handy when having access to a graphical user interface is just not possible. Because it was written and designed in Windows I didn't take into account some aesthetics aspects when running in a bash terminal. 

Tested on Windows 10 and Arch Linux 5.18.6 using Python 3.10.5.
